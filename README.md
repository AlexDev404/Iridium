# Iridium
An attempt to make an open-source Fortnite (1.8) game server. Currently, this is a (very unfinished) PoC with more coming soon.

Pull Requests and Issues are appreciated, thank you!

# Building & Usage
Iridium uses .NET 5, just Build and Run! By default, Iridium listens on (UDP) port 7777.

You can join the local-server by typing `open 127.0.0.1` into console.

# License
Iridium uses the GPLv3 license, please read `LICENSE` to ensure you don't violate it.
